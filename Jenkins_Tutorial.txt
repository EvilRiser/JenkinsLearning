Jenkins:
==============

 --> Jenkins container setup
 --> Create multibranch pipeline with git repo
 --> Types of credential
 --> Jenkinsfile

 1. Run Jenkins in Docker container
    -- find the jenkins image from dockerhub
    -- use from jenkins/jenkins as official image has been depricated 
     $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
    Docker run options:
        - Expose port 8080 --> by default run in this port.
        - Expose port 50000 --> this is where master/slave communicate
        - run in detached mode --> run container in background
        - bind named volume --> persists data of jenkins
    -- $ docker logs <img_id>--> to get the uname pwd
                                5e1b33dc3e9440fcb363491e96567c82 
    -- go to localhost:8080
    -- paste the pwd
    --once done suggested installation create admin user
        -- jenkins-user
        -- ss1234
        -- ss1234
        -- jenkins
        -- shaurabh.saha@gmail.com
        -- http://localhost:8080/
    
    -- create new item 
        - free style project
    Types of jenkins Project:
    - Freestyle                 - Pipeline                  - Multibranch Pipeline
     simple,single tasks        whole delivery cycle            like pipeline
     eg: run tests              eg:test|build|..              for multiple branch
                                    for a single
                                    branch
        - manage jenkins: add/install/uninstall all plugins
                            configure plugins
 2. create new item
    - my-pipeline -> multibranch
    - git -> git url -> branch by regx(java regx)
        -> from Jenkinsfile
    Credentials:
    -> Manage Jenkins -> Credentials -> System -> Global credentials (unrestricted)
        --> Add credentials
            - Credentials Scope:
                -- System --> Only available on jenkins server 
                            NOT for Jenkins job
                -- Global --> Everywhere accessible(all the build jobs/pipeline)
            - Type of pwd:
                -- username & pwd
                -- certificate
                -- secret file
                -- ssh username with pvt key
                -- secret text
            - username: - global
            - pwd: - ss1234
            - id: - global (how you will identify)
    Create 2 credentials: 1.global 2.system
    --> Now in your pipeline there is another credential, its scope is proj

    Proj Credentials:
      - Dashboard -> my-pipeline -> Credentials -> Folder -
            -> Global credentials (unrestricted)
      - Add Credentials
            kind: uname & pwd
            uname: my-pipeline
            pwd: ss1234
            id: my-pipeline
    ** system credentials are not available in your proj now.
    - Add your git cred in pipeline cred and add that in git cred.
 
 3. Discover Branches
        - Branch sources:
           - Discover Branch: Filter by name(with regx)
            - dev|master|feature
            - ^dev|master|feature.*$
                --> check any character name feature at any no of time.
